      description: |
        The ADC Clock specifier at the input of the peripheral.
        On some series, it could be either ASYNChronous (derived from the domain clock)
        or SYNChronous (derived from the AHB or APB).
        In each case, a specific prescaler can be applied to reduce the input frequency.
        It is combined to the st,prescaler to define the exact ADC clock freq.
        Refer to the RefMan to know the possible schemes.
        The property must have two integer elements:
        - first:  SYNC or ASYNC to select synchronous or asynchronous specific clock
        - second: divider which is an integer from 1 to 256
        (some stm32 may have only limited nb of divider. For example on stm32F2 :
        SYNC of 4 (possibly 2, 4, 6, 8) will give st,prescaler = <SYNC 4>;
