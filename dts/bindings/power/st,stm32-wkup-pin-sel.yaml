  STM32 system wakeup Node for stm32U5
  where each pin is multiplexed and
  when polarity and pull-up/down are configurable for each pin.

compatible: "st,stm32-wkup-pin-sel"

properties:
  syswakeup-pin:
    type: int
    description: |
      nb (index) of the sys wakeup pin associated with the GPIO
      For example PC13 is associated with wakeup pin nb <2> on the stm32u5

  syswakeup-sel:
    type: int
    enum :
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2    
    description: |
      signal selection [0,1,2] of the sys wakeup pin associated with the GPIO
      For example PC13 is associated with wakeup signal 1

  "#wkpin-cells":
    type: int
    const: 1
    description: |
      reference to the system wakeup pin
      with its polarity config to trig the wakeup event.

# Parameter syntax of stm32 follows the st,stm32-pwr dts syntax

wkpin-cells:
  - polarity
