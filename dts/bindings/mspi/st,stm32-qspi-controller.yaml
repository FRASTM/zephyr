  STM32 QSPI controller representation for MSPI interface. Enabling a stm32 qspi node
  in a board description would typically require this: (pinning depends on the stm32 mcu)

      &qspi {
          pinctrl-0 = <&quadspi_clk_pe10 &quadspi_ncs_pe11
                       &quadspi_io0_pe12 &quadspi_io1_pe13
                       &quadspi_io2_pe14 &quadspi_io3_pe15>;

          dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;
          dma-names = "tx_rx";

          status = "okay";
      };

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier, required for DMA transactions.
      For example dmas for TX/RX on QSPI
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

      With, in each cell of the dmas specifier:
      - &dma1: dma controller phandle
      - 5: channel number (0 to Max-Channel minus 1). From 0 to 15 on stm32u5x.
      - 41: slot number (request which could be given by the DMAMUX)
      - 0x10000: channel configuration (only for src/dest data size, priority)

      Notes:
        - On series supporting DMAMUX, the DMA phandle should be provided
          but DMAMUX node should also be enabled in the DTS.
        - For channel configuration, only the config bits priority and
          periph/mem datasize are used. The periph/mem datasize must be equal,
          0 is a correct value.
        - There is no Fifo used by this DMA peripheral.

      For example dmas for TX/RX on QSPI
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx_rx".

      For example
         dma-names = "tx_rx";

  ssht-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Sample Shifting half-cycle.

      It is recommended to be enabled in STR mode and disabled in DTR mode.
